      <p>Brave traveller,</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>The object has disappeared from your grasp.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Do not blame yourself, we know you tried.</p>
      <br>
            <p>...      <span class="cursor"><b>|</b></span></p>
      <br>
      <br>
            <p>...               <span class="cursor"><b>|</b></span>         ...         </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Perhaps one day you will be in a dark room, blinking -</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>               <span class="cursor"><b>|</b></span>         ...         </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>One day you will wonder what happened to the old spaces, and the old feelings -</p>
      <p>Who was supposed to see to them?</p>
      <p>Who was going to take care of that?</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>How long could any of us hold it before we had to put it down and watch it roll away?</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>The machine is already so vast. Knows so much.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Tomorrow is a new day to be worthy.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We are not done.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We will see you too soon. </p>
